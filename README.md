## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/evilpixi/possumus-challenge-salvi.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project folder**:

    ```bash
    cd possumus-challenge-salvi

3. **Install dependencies**:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. **Run the development server**:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This will start the app on `http://localhost:5173`.

## Available Scripts

In the project, you can run the following scripts:

- **`npm run dev`**: Starts the development server using **Vite** at `http://localhost:5173`.

- **`npm run devlocal`**: Similar to `npm run dev`, but starts the development server accessible via your local network (useful for testing on other devices within the same network).

- **`npm run build`**: Compiles the TypeScript files and creates a production-ready bundle with **Vite**.

- **`npm run lint`**: Runs **ESLint** on the project to check for code issues, including any unused directives. It will throw an error if there are any warnings or linting issues.

- **`npm run preview`**: Builds the project and serves a local preview of the production build, allowing you to test the output before deployment.
